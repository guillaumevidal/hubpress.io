=== Testing AsciiDoc 

Starting blogging *and* learning a yet some new syntax at the same time might be hard, but it's pretty cool that I can have a blog on github, for free, and update it with git. 

WARNING: This blog probably won't be updated often.



I'm really liking http://hubpress.io/[Hubpress] so far, the live preview is very sleek, really works as advertised. 

I wonder if Asciidoc is a markdown flavor or something else entirely.

Well, that's it for now.
