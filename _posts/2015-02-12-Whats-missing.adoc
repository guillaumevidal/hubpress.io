= What's missing

* Tags are seemingly functional but actually take you to a Github 404
* No way to add images from the browser editor
* No way to create pages other than the blog posts
* _Can't figure out the cover image_
* See more posts link not working either
* _Most themes broken_
* No strikethrough

NOTE: The separate blocks don't have an image displayed, and thus look bad in the actual posts, even though everything is fine in the editor preview.
