= Jam of the Day #4	

:hp-tags: music, jotd, rap

2015 has been incredible so far in hip hop. We're only getting into April and we've already seen releases by Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Big Sean, Action Bronson, Earl, Joey Bada$$, Ghostface, Lupe Fiasco, Cannibal Ox and Wale. And still waiting for stuff from Kanye, Tyler, and Busta _at least_. 
Crazy.

Today's jam is by Mr Baklava himself, AKA Bronsolino AKA Action Bronson.
